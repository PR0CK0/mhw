# Monster Hunter World : Player Support Project
MHW : PSP is an application written in Java and SQL, using the JDBC framework. 
It provides the functionality to search all items, armor, charms, weapons, palico equipment pieces, monsters and quests in the game, 
as well as the ability to create one's own custom armor set.

In order to get this to run, you must download the included .jar files in the lib folder. Set them up in your classpath. I used
the Eclipse IDE. Also, you need to enable a CSS/HTML editor extension in your IDE if you want to be able to use the stylesheet...

The database is NOT publicly hosted, and this project is for the class Database and File Systems taught by Richard S. Stansbury (https://github.com/richss). However, feel free to use the .sql file containing all the armor, charms, weapons and palico equipments in the game.
